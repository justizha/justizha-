Meow, meow, meow, meow~

What a creatureâ€”so fragile yet strong. Sometimes when I look at a cat who's just lying down carelessly on the floor, I wonder what this creature thinks about. Sometimes they look at me like I'm their own personal maid or assistant.

But on random occasions when I'm not feeling well or feeling a bit sad, it feels like they know. They usually become more calm and just want to be closer to me. I don't personally own a cat, but the boarding house that I currently stay at has one. Sometimes I let her come into my room. Because she's rather young for a cat, she's usually more active, wandering around with curiosity. But when I'm feeling down or sad, she just sits beside me and looks at me. It feels like she knows what I'm feeling.

I sometimes think that cats understand you more than other humans do, which is quite sad. Or perhaps we're just afraid to show our vulnerability to others.
