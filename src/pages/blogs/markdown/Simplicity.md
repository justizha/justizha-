<h2>Simplicity.</h2>

At some point in time i really really like seeing more and more complicated stuff , back then it just so fascinating for me to see some really complex stuff and i said to my self "hm this is so damn cool" , until recently i worked into large project an app for a hospital and seeing the code , the data structure and so on, it made me realize maybe complexity wasn't the coolest thing

And now i started to appreciate more about simplicity, more i think of it more and more i admires it . Most of the time more simple it gets the more good it became, and yeah i can see it now, not only about ui ux or a program it also about the life itself.
