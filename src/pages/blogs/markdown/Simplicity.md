# Simplicity

At some point in time I **really** like seeing more and more complicated stuff, back then it was just so fascinating for me to see some really complex stuff and I said to myself "hm this is so damn cool", until recently I worked into large project an app for a hospital and seeing the code, the data structure and so on, it made me realize maybe complexity wasn't the coolest thing.

And now I started to appreciate more about _simplicity_, more I think of it more and more I admire it. Most of the time more simple it gets the more good it became, and yeah I can see it now, not only about ui ux or a program it also about the life itself.
